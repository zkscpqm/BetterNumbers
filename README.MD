# BetterNumbers lib

## Overview

This is meant to be a library for more advanced/complex mathematical operations, mainly ones needed for machine learning/deep learning. 
My main purpose for writing this is learning C++ and algorithmic/mathematical programming.

### Finished:

### In Progress:

#### Linear algebra
  - Matrices
  - Systems of equations
  - Projections and orthogonalization
  - Eigendecomposition
  - Singular value decomposition
  - Quadratic form and definiteness

### Planned:

#### Probability and statistics
  - Joint and conditional probability
  - Probability distributions
  - Bayesian Statistics
  - The normal distribution
  - Joint random variables
  - Sampling
  - Linear regression
  - Multiple regression
  - Decision analysis
